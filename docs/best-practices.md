# J2CL Best Practices



## Build Performance

To improve build performance we recommend adding a .bazelrc file in your
workspace root, which will be checked into version control and shared with your
team and CI. Start by copying the
[one from J2CL](https://github.com/google/j2cl/blob/master/.bazelrc).

## Library Naming: use -j2cl suffix.

Instances of `j2cl_library` should be named the same as the corresponding
`java_library` with a `-j2cl` suffix. This brings consistency across different
project and makes it easier for other developers and macros that generate
`j2cl_library` to predict the names of dependencies.

```python
java_library(
  name = "utils",
  deps = ":mydep",
)

j2cl_library(
  name = "utils-j2cl",
  deps = ":mydep-j2cl",
)
```

## Super Sourcing: writing platform specific code

One of J2CL's greatest benefits is that your Java code runs on many platforms.
You may want to have slightly different implementations for code that runs on
Android vs code that runs on the web (different best practices or runtime
environment differences). Super sourcing refers to the practice of swapping out
the implementation of a class that implements the same api but runs differently
in another environment.

When super sourcing, don't write stubs that fail at runtime. Instead, write
fully compatible super-source replacements that work at runtime and have usage
of incompatible apis fail at compile time.

#### Sample Implementation:

There are many examples for code you may want to super source, for example,
network calls, writing to a local database for persistence, or in this case,
logging to the console. In the JVM logging writes to `stdout`, in the browser,
it calls `console.log`.

```java
// Logger.java
// Other examples could be wiring to a local db, or making a network call.
class Logger {
  /** Logs to stdout with a timestamp. */
  public static void log(String s) {
    System.out.println(getTime() + " " + s);
  }

  private static String getTime() {
    return System.currentTimeMillis() + "";
  }
}
```

The convention is to place super sources in a folder called `super-j2cl/` :

```java
// super-j2cl/Logger.java
// Elemental imports omitted.
class Logger {
  /** Logs to stdout with a timestamp. */
  public static void log(String s) { // Maintain same public api.
    Console.log(getTime() + " " + s);
  }

  private static String getTime() {
    return new Date().getTime() + "";
  }
}
```

Swap out the Java implementation in the build.

```python
java_library(
  name = "logger",
  srcs = [ "Logger.java", ],
  deps = ":mydep",
)

j2cl_library(
  name = "logger-j2cl",
  srcs = [
    "super-j2cl/Logger.java", # swaperoo
  ],
  deps = ":mydep-j2cl",
)
```

#### `@GwtIncompatible`:

The `@GwtIncompatible` annotation allows you to strip specific elements from
your code including classes, methods, and members. It's designed to strip
incompatible methods from your code before they are seen by the J2CL compiler.
`@GwtIncompatible` is effective for removing parts of your API that you don't
want to be available to J2CL code. It is usually a good idea to document the
reason in the annotation e.g.:

```java
@GwtIncompatible("java.lang.Thread is unavailable in web").
```

In general, it is not recommended to use `@GwtIncompatible` in application logic
to disable specific code paths, for example by disabling an overriding method,
since it can lead to confusing differences in behavior as well as causing
`@GwtIncompatible` to propagate further and further through your code. It is
better to restructure code and abstract out incompatible parts and super source
the code such that it does something meaningful on the web.

## Code Size and Runtime Performance

### Closure Compiler Flags

One of J2CL's core advantage is tight integration with the
[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/). Code
generated by J2CL is fully type-safe JavaScript code that can be compiled by
Closure Compiler with advanced optimization flags. In addition to that Closure
Compiler also detects J2CL generated code and enables special passes that
optimize patterns that are specific to code generated from Java, which all
together yields excellent code size and code splitting.

For the best results, use `J2CL_OPTIMIZED_DEFS` which enables all the advanced
optimizations:

```python
load("//build_defs:rules.bzl", "J2CL_OPTIMIZED_DEFS")

js_binary(
    name = "optimized_j2cl_app",
    defs = J2CL_OPTIMIZED_DEFS,
    deps = [":js_lib"],
)
```

### JRE Configuration

There are JRE configuration options which can be tuned to reduce code size and
improve runtime performance. By default, these options are set to their most
conservative values as to accurately preserve Java semantics and behavior.

#### JRE Runtime Checks Configuration

Closure compiler flag: `--define=jre.checks.checkLevel=NORMAL|OPTIMIZED|MINIMAL`

Allows the suppression of certain runtime checks in the Java Standard library
which allows for the code for those checks to be completely removed in
production.

<!-- mdformat off(breaks tables in github markdown) -->

Group     |Description                                          |Common Exception Types
----------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------
`BOUNDS`  |Checks related to bound checking in collections.     |`IndexOutBoundsException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
`API`     |Checks related to the correct usage of various APIs.  |`IllegalStateException`, `NoSuchElementException`, `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, `ConcurrentModificationException`
`NUMERIC` |Checks related to numeric operations.                |`ArithmeticException`
`TYPE`    |Checks related to runtime Java type consistency.     |`ClassCastException`, `ArrayStoreException`
`CRITICAL`|Checks for cases where not failing-fast will keep the object in an inconsistent state and/or degrade debugging significantly. Currently disabling these checks is not supported.                             |`IllegalArgumentException`

<!-- mdformat on -->

Following table summarizes predefined check levels:

Check level        | BOUNDS | API | NUMERIC | TYPE | CRITICAL
------------------ | :----: | :-: | :-----: | :--: | :------:
`NORMAL` (default) | x      | x   | x       | x    | x
`OPTIMIZED`        |        |     |         | x    | x
`MINIMAL`          |        |     |         |      | x

**Note that this configuration should be set to same value for both debugging
and production in order to detect user code that incorrectly relies on specific
exceptions to be thrown.**

#### Class Metadata Stripping

Closure compiler flag: `--define=jre.classMetadata=SIMPLE|STRIPPED`

Allows the compiler to remove metadata associated with `java.lang.Class` and
reduce code size.

Note that stripping class metadata has several implications:

*   Class names are replaced with auto-generated obfuscated names that are not
    maintained across different runs of the application.
*   `Class.isEnum()`, `Class.isPrimitive()`, `Class.isInterface()` always return
    `false`.

Enum constant names can be obfuscated or stripped (TODO(goktug): document how).
Class names can be obfuscated (TODO(goktug): document how).

#### Logging

Closure compiler flag:
`"--define=jre.logging.logLevel=OFF|SEVERE|WARNNG|INFO|ALL`

When using `java.util.logging.Logger`, you may specify a logging level. You can
disable these logging statements (and have them dead-code stripped) in
production JavaScript code.


### Custom Compile-Time Code Stripping

You can implement your own configuration based stripping with
`System.getProperty()`. In the following example, the compiler will statically
evaluate the condition and remove the entire if/else control statement.

```java
if (System.getProperty("some.define") == "YES") {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

```python
js_binary(
    name = "optimized_j2cl_app",
    defs = ["--define=some.define=YES"] + J2CL_OPTIMIZED_DEFS,
    deps = [":js_lib"],
)
```

### Much Java, such size

When developing in Java, its natural to reach for common libraries such as
[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava). However, the use of such libraries
should be evaluated with some caution. It can come with a non-trivial increase
in code size (and compile time) in your fully optimized application. In general,
you may want to be more conservative in pulling in non-critical J2CL
dependencies than in regular Java projects. Remember that you are writing code
that runs in a web browser!

Additionally, APT based code generation such as
[Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) or
[AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value) can have
surprising impact on compile time and code size if used without awareness of the
implications. Generated code is rarely inspected which can lead to hidden code
verbosity. These APTs are designed for convenience, without code size in mind.
