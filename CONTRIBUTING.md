### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement][CLA]
(CLA), which you can do online.
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution, this simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current
agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted
one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.


### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
