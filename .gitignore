# NOTE: we don't include OS- or IDE/editor-specific files (e.g. Windows' Thumbs.db,
# OSX's .DS_Store, Vim's *.swp, Emacs' *~, Visual Studio Code's .vscode, etc.) on-purpose.
# Those patterns should go in a global gitignore or repository-specific excludes.
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for how to configure your environment.
# See https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global for a list of global ignore rules.
