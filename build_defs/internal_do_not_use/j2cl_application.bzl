    This generates couple of convenient pre-configured targets:
      <name>: closure_js_binary target that could be used for production.
      <name>_dev: closure_js_binary target that could be used for development.
      <name>_dev_server: a simple development server for simple apps.

    The devserver could be provided by extra resources. A custom host page can
    also be supplied as a resource where the development resources could be
    loaded by <link rel="import" href="<your_target_dev.html">.
    TODO(goktug): Document what needs to be done by apps with custom development
    server.

    Note: This macro is pretty bare bones right now but please let us know what
    kind of customizations you may need so we can look into incorparating them!

    Args:
        name: name of the rule.
        entry_points: JavaScript namespace of the entry point for the app.
        deps: dependencies of the app (e.g. j2cl_library, js_library, etc).
        rewrite_polyfills: rewrite ES6 library calls to use polyfills provided
          by the compiler's runtime to support "old" browsers. Only affects
          production binary.
        jre_logging_log_level: the minimum log level that java.util.logging
            should capture for production; the rest is optimized away.
        jre_checks_check_level: the level of checks provided by Java standard
          library emulation in production; the rest is optimized away.
          Note that development binary will still do checks but will throw
          assertion errors instead to prevent user code to incorrectly rely on
          specific exceptions to be thrown.
        closure_defines: override the value of a variable defined by goog.define.
        extra_dev_resources: extra resource to serve for development server.
