# This is the bazel target that compiles our J2CL library. Note that our HelloWorld library

# code in your library but it can come in handy in some situations.
# Globing beyond a package is considered a bad practice and for legacy apps. Keeping libraries
# not too big will help with parallelization and performance of the build.
